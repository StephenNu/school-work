60-100 Key Concepts of Computer Science
==========
contains all miranda code, solving simple problems with a functional langauge.

60-140 Introduction to Algorithms part 1
==========

60-141 Introduction to Algorithms part 2
==========
Taught slightly more advanced c programming, including pointers, lists and more complex algorithms.

60-254 Data structures and Algorithms
==========
Contains partial C++ standard complient data structures where I was able to make it work inside the professors assignments. I had never coded in c++ before this, so this was all learning.

60-256 System Programming
==========
Contains for the first part Bash scripts and code, and second half c code using system calls and the like for unix programming.
