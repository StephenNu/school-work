school-work
===========
This repository will contain some of my hand-ins for my school assignments.

60-100 Key Concepts of Computer Science
==========
60-100 contains all miranda code, solving simple problems with a functional langauge.

60-140 Introduction to Algorithms part 1
==========
60-140 Taught basic c programming language, and simple approaches to designing algorithms.

60-141 Introduction to Algorithms part 2
==========
60-141 Taught slightly more advanced c programming, including pointers, lists and more complex algorithms.

60-231 Theoretical Foundations of Computer Science
==========
60-231 Is mathematical and formal proof logic, assignments were written in LaTex, and complied to pdf.

60-254 Data structures and Algorithms
==========
60-254 Contains partial C++ standard complient data structures where I was able to make it work inside the professors assignments. I had never coded in c++ before this, so this was all learning.

60-256 System Programming
==========
60-256 Contains for the first part Bash scripts and code, and second half c code using system calls and the like for unix programming.
