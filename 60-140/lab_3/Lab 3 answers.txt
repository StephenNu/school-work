Question 1
	by hand
	
	In main	    		a	b	c	x	y	z
After 1st call to FindSum	2 	5	31	3	4	7
After 2nd call to FindSum	2 	5	31 	3	4	31
 
	In FindSum			a	b	*c
	After 1st call to FindSum	12 	15	31
	After 2nd call to FindSum	11	12	31

	
	Program:
	in Findsum: 12 15 31
	first call in main 2 5 31 3 4 7
	in Findsum: 11 12 31
	second call in main 2 5 31 3 4 31

Question 2
	a) The scope is the visibility of the variable. a gobal variable can be seen by any function but a local is invisibel to another function.
	b) where the variable is declared gives it it scope.
	c) it is easier to trace if everything in a function is not modified by other functions.
	

4.1 question 1
a)	local variables are defined inside the method and global is defined and 	able to be seen by all methods.
b)	function prototype shows the templete for the function parameters and name, and function definition is where the code resides.
c)	a function definition is the coding of the function and a function call is when it is called in main, and will be run.
d)	call-by-reference is when a pointer to the variable is passed, and call-by-value is a copy of the data.
e)	cohesion allows functions to perform independentlly, and coupling allows passing of current data through parameters, etc
f)	flowchart is an algorithm that shows how the program "flows" through the program, and a structure chart shows all the different method designs, and how the class is set up.
g)	formal parameters are the names used inside the definition, and actual parameters are the parameters passed when the function is called.
