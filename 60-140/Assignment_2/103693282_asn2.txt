i.  Problem Definition: With the input of the length and width for both the grass covered yard, and the house. Then calculate how many square feet, 
and square Meters for both house and yard and grass covered area of the yard, and with a rate of 2 square feet per second calculate the time required.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
ii.                 Identify all input, output data and their type as well as relationships between input and output data in equations:

Input data are:
Real Numbers;
length_yardft, width_yardft, length_houseft, width_houseft
 
Output data are:
Integers;
hours, minutes, seconds,
yard_squareft, yard_square_meter, house_squareft, house_square_meter, grass_yard_squareft, grass_yard_square_meter, yard_perimeterft, yard_perimeter_meter, house_perimeterft, house_perimeter_meter

Transitent data are,
Real Numbers;
length_yard_meter, width_yard_meter, length_house_meter, width_house_meter.
grass, full_time_seconds.

Constant data,
Real numbers;
mow_speed = 2, meter_convert = .3048.

Equations that link output data variables on the left hand side with input data variables on the right hand side in the correct logical order they will work are:

yard_squareft = length_yardft * width_yardft.
house_squareft = length_houstft * width_houstft.
length_yard_meter = length_yardft * meter_convert.
width_yard_meter = width_yardft * meter_convert.
yard_sqaure_meter = width_yard_meter * length_yard_meter.
length_house_meter = length_houseft * meter_convert.
width_house_meter = width_houseft * meter_convert.
house_sqaure_meter = width_house_meter * length_house_meter.
grass_yard_squareft = yard_squareft - house_squareft.
grass_yard_square_meter = yard_square_meter - house_square_meter.
yard_perimeterft = 2 * (length_yardft + width_yardft).
yard_perimeter_meter = 2 * (length_yard_meter + width_yard_meter).
house_perimeterft = 2 * (length_houseft + width_houseft).
house_perimeter_meter = 2 * (length_house_meter + width_house_meter).
full_time_seconds = grass_yard_squareft / 2.
hours = full_time_seconds / (60 * 60);
full_time_seconds -= hours * (60 * 60);
minutes = full_time_seconds / 60;

iii.                  No need to break the problem solution into smaller modules now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

iv.                 Write the algorithmic solution using the template for an algorithm similar to the formal algorithmic structure in Figure 3.1 of text book. Use the following template now.
