1) 192.168.1.101 is my host while the destination host has ip of 143.89.14.34

2) ICMP sits at the IP level and doesn't deal with ports like TCP and UDP. it always uses the same port which is 1.

3) I will examine packet 3 the code was 0, and the type was 8. Other fields are
a) checksum (2 bytes)
b) Identifier (BE) (2 bytes big endian)
c) Identifier (LE) (2 bytes little endian)
d) Sequence number (BE) (2 bytes)
e) Sequence number (LE) (2 bytes)

4) the code is 0 and the type is 0, the other fields are the same as 3.

5) I choose packet 2, the ip address of my host was 192.168.1.101 while the destination host was 10.216.228.1

6) yes

7) Yes this one has a ttl and other information so that it can trace the route.

8) The contain addition fields that store the original request that was sent. both the IP level and the ICMP level.

9) They are not error messages. This is because they successfully reached the destination before their TTL expired.

10) step 10 to 11 had a huge difference in my personal screenshot while in the screenshot provided in the lab it occured between steps 9 and 10. In the lab provided screenshot the jump occured when transmitting from a ISP in the States to one in France.

IP

1) expanded it. my ip address is 192.168.1.102

2) ICMP (1) is the value

3) 20 bytes for the entire IP header. and 64 bytes in the payload. I moved the selection over and read the value from the bottom left.

4) No we can tell because there was no reassembled segments.

5) TTL and Identification always change, and checksum will most likely always change.

6) Everything else stays the same. 

7) They are in order. increasing by one each time.

8) The first segmented packet was 92.

9) it says [two IPv4 fragments ... ] in wireshark also the fragment offset is not 0. it also says what the payloads were 92 was the first.

10) identification is 0x32f9 (13049) TTL = 1

11) identification changes because its unique, and the ttl is always the same because its the first router.

12) it has a fragement offset. that isn't 0. only these two. (92 and 93)

13) total length, flags, checksum, fragments.

14) three fragments.

15) fragment offset, checksum, some flags.
